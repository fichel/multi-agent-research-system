      "research_plan='---\\n### 1. Search Strategy\\n- Approach:\\n  Combine broad web search, startup/VC databases, technology news outlets, social media, and conference/summit speaker lists to compile an over-sized long-list (≈150+) of U.S. companies declaring work on “AI agents” or closely related terms (autonomous agents, AI copilots, agentic workflow, LLM agents, multi-agent systems) in 2024-2025. Then filter to at least 100 unique firms, extract required metadata from official websites, press kits, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, product docs, and reviews.  Use four specialized sub-agents: (1) Discovery, (2) Verification & Fact-gathering, (3) Data Structuring, (4) QA & Gap-fill.\\n- Key Terms & Sub-questions:\\n  • Core terms: “AI agent startup”, “autonomous agent platform”, “LLM agents company”, “AI copilot SaaS”, “multi-agent systems company”, “agentic AI”.\\n  • Vertical variants: add keywords like customer service, devtools, cybersecurity, healthcare, finance, marketing, e-commerce, robotics, legal, HR, sales, data, IoT.\\n  • Sub-questions: Who raised funding for agentic AI in 2024-25? Which products market themselves as copilots/agents? What industry/vertical do they target? What specific agent type (chatbot, workflow, security, robotic, personal, developer, etc.)?\\n\\n### 2. What to Search For\\n- Resource 1: TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Forbes, Business Insider articles that list or profile AI-agent startups (to quickly surface names and funding context).\\n- Resource 2: Crunchbase / PitchBook filters for U.S. companies tagged \"Generative AI\", \"Autonomous Agents\", or products containing “agent”. Gives company basics and website.\\n- Resource 3: GitHub trending & Hacker News posts mentioning new agent frameworks/companies (captures early-stage or stealth companies with open-source footprints).\\n- Resource 4: Conference/summit speaker lists (e.g., Agents Summit, NeurIPS, AWS re:Invent generative AI track) to capture companies self-identifying with agent tech.\\n- Resource 5: Company press releases & blogs (for product names, descriptions, vertical positioning, type of agent built).\\n- Resource 6: LinkedIn company pages (for headcount, industry tags, concise descriptions).\\n\\n### 3. How Many to Search For\\n- Company discovery: Target ≈150 candidates to ensure ≥100 after de-duplication and relevance check.\\n- News articles: At least 40 unique 2024-25 articles using terms “AI agent startup” OR “autonomous agent company” (ensures breadth across verticals).\\n- VC database queries: 3 focused searches — “Autonomous Agents”, “AI Copilot”, “Generative AI + Workflow Automation” — expected to yield 200–300 rows; filter to U.S.\\n- GitHub/HN scans: Top 30 projects tagged agentic/LLM agents — surfaces open-source backed firms.\\n- Conference lists: 5 major 2024-25 AI events; extract every U.S. company speaker claiming agent technology.\\n\\nExample search terms & reasons:\\n1. \"\"AI agent startup funding 2025\"\" – captures newest entrants raising capital.\\n2. \"\"autonomous agent platform for developers\"\" – surfaces dev-tool vertical.\\n3. \"\"LLM agent healthcare\"\" – vertical slice.\\n4. \"\"agentic workflows fintech\"\" – niche use-case.\\n5. \"\"Agents Summit 2025 speakers\"\" – conference source.\\n\\n### 4. Step-by-Step Plan\\n1. Discovery Sub-agent: Run broad web and news searches with master list of core terms + vertical variants; dump candidate company names & URLs into a spreadsheet.\\n2. VC Database Query: Use Crunchbase/PitchBook filters; export U.S. companies founded ≤2025 with relevant tags; merge into spreadsheet.\\n3. Open-source & Community Scan: Scrape GitHub repos and HN posts containing “agent” + “AI” + “company” to capture OSS-rooted firms.\\n4. Conference & Award List Mining: Collect company names from 2024-25 agent-themed conference agendas and AI awards.\\n5. De-duplicate & Relevance Check: Remove non-U.S. or non-agent companies; aim for ≥150 raw list.\\n6. Verification Sub-agent: Visit each company site/LinkedIn/press kit; record product name, description, vertical, agent type.\\n7. Data Structuring Sub-agent: Normalize fields (Name, Website, Product, Description, Agent Type, Vertical/Industry).\\n8. QA & Gap-fill Sub-agent: Cross-verify missing fields via secondary searches; ensure final list has ≥100 fully populated entries.\\n9. Prepare final report/table for user.\\n---' number_of_sub_agents=4 web_search_plan=WebSearchPlan(items=[WebSearchItem(query='\"AI agent startup\" 2025 funding United States', reason='Find recent U.S. startups branding themselves around AI agents and raising funds.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"autonomous agent platform\" company site:.ai OR site:.com', reason='Locate platforms explicitly marketing autonomous agents.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"AI copilot\" SaaS platform US', reason='Many agent companies position as copilots; captures relevant verticals.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"LLM agents\" healthcare startup', reason='Surface healthcare-specific agent companies.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"multi-agent\" cybersecurity company United States', reason='Find cybersecurity agent startups.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"Agents Summit\" 2025 speakers list', reason='Conference rosters give authoritative list of agent-focused companies.'), WebSearchItem(query='site:crunchbase.com \"autonomous agents\" US companies', reason='Directly query Crunchbase for tagged companies.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"generative ai\" workflow automation startup 2024', reason='Many agent firms are framed as workflow automation using gen-AI.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"open-source\" agent framework backed by company', reason='Identify companies commercializing open-source agent frameworks.'), WebSearchItem(query='\"AI agent\" conference award winners 2024', reason='Awards can highlight credible agent companies.')])\n"
